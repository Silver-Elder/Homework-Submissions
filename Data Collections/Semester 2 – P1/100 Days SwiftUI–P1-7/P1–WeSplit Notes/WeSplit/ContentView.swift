(Remember that the only way we could have part of a struct change a variable in the struct was if we created a mutating func. We can't make a mutatin computer var, however (which is what our var body is), so we use this @State method instead)
    // For a better idea of what the @State is doing, take a look at this mock state setup code (Note: this shows the concept, not the actual design)

        VStack { // For whatever reason, xCode will allow me to create two "parent views" â€“ in this case, my Button and NavigationView â€“ and while my preview will display these two parent view separately, the views are automaticlly combined when the app is run. This works because of the finicky way that xCode is set up, but I shouldn't be able to do that. To combine these views the PROPER way, I should embed these two views in a VStack, as shown here. What problems would occur if I didn't, beyond the preview and running app not aligning? I honetsly have no clue ðŸ˜…
            // The best way to fix this problem would really be to put the button inside the NavigationView, so I'll comment out this button to show what I was talking about before, and re-add the button in the NavView

                        // Note: In our loop, 'students' is the data source which the loop is reading to create a 'Text' field for each itm in our 'students' array. The 'id' tells the computer that this item being added by the loop to the picker should be distinguished by the value, any type of that value which was passed in (which in this case is the name of the student, which is of 'String' type). This tells the computer that it should update its UI if the value and type we change in the 'students' array matches the value and type id we set for that Picker's content item. If we DID have two identical strings in our array (say, two "Ron"s), we might run into problems. What to do in that case is yet to be explained.
