 "To create a custom modifier, create a new struct that conforms to the ViewModifier protocol. This has only one requirement, which is a method called body that accepts whatever content it’s being given to work with, and must return some View":

// "We can now use that with the modifier() modifier – yes, it’s a modifier called “modifier”, but it lets us apply any sort of modifier to a view" (Hacking with Swift), (see "Text("Hello World").modifier(Title())").

/* "When working with custom modifiers, it’s usually a smart idea to create extensions on View that make them easier to use. For example, we might wrap the Title modifier in an extension such as this:

// Note: "Often folks wonder when it’s better to add a custom view modifier versus just adding a new method to View, and really it comes down to one main reason: custom view modifiers can have their own stored properties, whereas extensions to View cannot" (Hacking with Swift).
