// "We can now use that with the modifier() modifier ‚Äì yes, it‚Äôs a modifier called ‚Äúmodifier‚Äù, but it lets us apply any sort of modifier to a view" (Hacking with Swift), (see "Text("Hello World").modifier(Title())").

/* "When working with custom modifiers, it‚Äôs usually a smart idea to create extensions on View that make them easier to use. For example, we might wrap the Title modifier in an extension such as this:

// "We can now use the modifier like this:
