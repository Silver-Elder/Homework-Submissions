(Remember that the only way we could have part of a struct change a variable in the struct was if we created a mutating func. We can't make a mutatin computer var, however (which is what our var body is), so we use this @State method instead)
    // For a better idea of what the @State is doing, take a look at this mock state setup code (Note: this shows the concept, not the actual design)

This works because of the finicky way that xCode is set up, but I shouldn't be able to do that. To combine these views the PROPER way, I should embed these two views in a VStack, as shown here. What problems would occur if I didn't, beyond the preview and running app not aligning? I honetsly have no clue ðŸ˜…
            // The best way to fix this problem would really be to put the button inside the NavigationView, so I'll comment out this button to show what I was talking about before, and re-add the button in the NavView
